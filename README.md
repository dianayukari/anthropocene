# Anthropocene

This project explores the contested definition of the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch. The website visually contrasts two perspectives: the vast, uneventful timeline of Earth's history challenges the Anthropocene's significance, while a dramatic finale highlights humanity's recent, intense impact.

A project created for the Design Studio 2A class of the Information Design Master, at the Design Academy Eindhoven.
